# Random-Cypher
A program that "encrypts" messages so that randos can't just read them, it can also reverse it.

This is version 2 of the RCCG(Random Ceasar Cypher Generator). Ment to simplify the creation of "encrypted" messages allong with decoding them.
V2 just changes the output format of the shifted message so that you only have to copy and paste the output into the decode input to get the original message,
along with this the encoded message and code seems very random to the naked eye and it pretty much is.

Anybody can suggest or even modify it just let me know if you plan on doing it and share your own version with me, I'd love to see what else other people can think of
